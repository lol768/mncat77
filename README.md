My repo for the ten.java contest

Theme: Books

Compile and run against the 1.6.4 RB

Write a book and left click the air with it:
Create world, attributes depending on the words written in the book, name of the world is the title of the book

If you want to keep the same generator for the worlds add the plugin as generator in the bukkit.yml
e.g.:
worlds:
  world:
    generator: FictionWorld
    
Attributes will automatically be saved by the plugin.

All the breaks with BlockPopulators and the manual bukkit.yml entries are fault of the Bukkit API, not mine.

I didn't have the time or performance to make the terrain look much better :/
